# SimplePortfolioOptimizer

Takes a matrix of historical returns and generates a portfolio optimized to user-defined criteria, based on the naive
(and flawed) assumption that investment returns are normally distributed, using a gradient descent algorithm.

I created this script to try to find a solution to a portfolio-optimization problem that turned out not to have any solution
(there was an error in the problem statement), while taking UQAM's ACT4310 actuarial finance class.

actually risk your money (or worse, other people's money) using this code's output, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THUS
INCURRED.
